# ASABE 2024 Robotics Competition Plant
This repository contains the files needed to print (and possibly modify for tolerancing) the simulation plant for the 2024 ASABE robotics competition.

# Terminology
Trunk - The center core which fits into the game board and holds stems

Stem - The part that connects the trunk and leaves/flowers. It holds a 6mmx2.5mm magnet.

# Assembly
| Component                            | Quantity          | Link |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ---- |
| 6x2.5mm Magnet                       | 1 per stem        | -    |
| Flat Head Thumb Tack (11mm Diameter) | 1 per flower/leaf | -    |

## Instructions
1. Print a variety of stems, trunks, leaves, and flowers.
2. Press a 6x2.5mm magnet into the bottom of each stem.

# Division Differences
The competition is split into two divisions. More information about the differences between these two can be found in the 2024 release.

## Basic
Example Assembly: https://a360.co/4aaLmyi

For the basic division, all stems are placed on the same level.

## Advanced
Example Assembly: https://a360.co/3RiKY86

For the advanced division, both the vertical and radial position of a given leaf or flower can vary.
Stems can be short, medium, or long, and can be positioned at one of five vertical positions.
