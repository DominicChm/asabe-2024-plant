# Division Differences
The competition is split into two divisions. More information about the differences between these two can be found in the [2024 release](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JPMAodRuwTGvhz5UEUWVJHI-WIk5GcbBl3c8BVmr7d0/edit).

## Basic
Example Assembly: https://a360.co/4aaLmyi

For the basic division, all stems are placed on the same level.

## Advanced
Example Assembly: https://a360.co/3RiKY86

For the advanced division, both the vertical and radial position of a given leaf or flower can vary.
Stems can be short, medium, or long, and can be positioned at one of five vertical positions.

# Painting
All surfaces are spray painted with colors as follows:

# Assembly Instructions
1. Print an appropriate number of stalks, leaves, flowers, and stems (of various lengths) per the rules. If desired, CAD files may be modified as needed to achieve reliable press fits in the steps below (given your printer / material).
2. Press a 6 mm x 2 mm magnet into the bottom of each stem. Use super glue or hot glue (as needed) to reinforce the connection.
3. Press an upholstery tack into each leaf. Trim the sharp end of the tack flush against the end of the hole (e.g. with flush cutter).
4. Hot glue stems into stalks in a variety of arrangements per the rules.
5. Insert stems into holes in the "plant bed" 2 x 4s on the playing field.
